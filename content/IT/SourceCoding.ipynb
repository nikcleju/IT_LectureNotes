    "# Source Coding\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we take a look at the basic principles\n",
    "and algorithms for data compression.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The role of coding\n",
    "\n",
    "In the general block diagram of a communication system, \n",
    "the coding block is situated \n",
    "between the information source and the communication channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Communication system](img/CommBlockDiagram.png){width=35%}\n",
    "\n",
    "It's role is to prepare the raw information in order to be transmitted\n",
    "over the channel. It has two main jobs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Source coding**:\n",
    "   - Convert source messages to channel symbols, i.e. the actual \n",
    "     symbols which the channel knows to transmit.\n",
    "\n",
    "     For example, express the messages in binary form (zeros and ones), for sending over a binary channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Minimize the number of symbols needed to be transmitted (i.e., data compression). \n",
    "     We don't want to transmit more symbols than necessary to recover the messages at the receiving end.\n",
    " \n",
    "   - Adapt probabilities of symbols in order to maximize to maximize mutual information. \n",
    "   We will discuss this more in Chapter IV.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Error control coding**\n",
    "    - Protect the information against channel errors\n",
    "    - Also known as \"*channel coding*\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, source coding refers to all the procedures required to express\n",
    "the source messages as channel symbols in the most efficient way possible,\n",
    "while error control coding refers to all the algorithms used to\n",
    "protect the data against errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The coding block has a corresponding decoding block on the receiving end.\n",
    "Its job is to \"*undo*\" all the coding operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- detect and fix the errors in the received data, based on the algorithms introduced by the coding block\n",
    "- convert the channel symbols back into the message representations that the receiver expects\n",
    "\n",
    "Is it possible to do these two jobs separately, one after another, \n",
    "in two consecutive operations? Yes, as the **source-channel separation theorem** establishes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We give below only an informal statement of the theorem:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{prf:theorem} Source-channel separation theorem\n",
    "It is possible to obtain the best reliable communication by performing the\n",
    "two tasks **separately**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Source coding: to minimize number of symbols needed\n",
    "2. Error control coding (channel coding): to provide protection against errors happening on the channel\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we consider only the source coding algorithms, without any error control.\n",
    "Basically, we assume that data transmission is done over an ideal channel with no noise, \n",
    "and therefore the transmitted symbols are perfectly recovered at the receiver.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context, our main concern is how to minimize the number of symbols needed to represent the messages, while making sure that the receiver can decode the messages correctly. \n",
    "The advantages of data compression are self-evident:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Efficiency\n",
    "- Short communication times\n",
    "- Can decode easily\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's define what coding means from a mathematical perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an input information source with the set of messages:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$S = \\left\\lbrace s_1, s_2, ... s_N \\right\\rbrace$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and suppose we would like to express the messages as a sequence of the following **code symbols**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X = \\left\\lbrace x_1, x_2, ... x_M \\right\\rbrace$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The set $X$ is known as the **alphabet of the code**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for a binary code we have $X = \\lbrace 0, 1\\rbrace$ \n",
    "and a possible sequence of symbols is $c = 00101101$\n",
    "\n",
    "```{prf:definition} Code definition\n",
    "A **code** is a mapping from the set $S$ of $N$ messages\n",
    "to a set of $N$ sequences of symbols, known as **codewords**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C = \\left\\lbrace c_1, c_2, ... c_N \\right\\rbrace$$\n",
    "\n",
    "An example code mapping is given below: \n",
    "\n",
    " Message   |               | Codeword\n",
    "---------: | :----------:  | :----------\n",
    "$s_1$      | $\\rightarrow$ | $c_1 = x_1x_2x_1...$ \n",

    "$\\dots$    | $\\rightarrow$ | $\\dots$ \n",
    "$s_N$      | $\\rightarrow$ | $c_N = x_2x_2x_2...$ \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The codewords are the sequences of symbols used by the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **codeword length**, which we denote as $l_i$, \n",
    "is the the number of symbols in a given codeword $c_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Encoding** a given message or sequences of messages means \n",
    "replacing each message with its codeword.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decoding** means deducing back the original sequence of messages,\n",
    "given a sequence of symbols.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, the ASCII code is a widely-used code for encoding characters,\n",
    "consisting of 256 codewords (stored on 1 byte):\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- ![ASCII code (partial)](img/ASCIIcode.png){width=50%} -->\n",
    "![ASCII code (partial)](img/ASCIIcode.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Nowadays, ASCII is usually replaced by Unicode (UTF-8), which is a more general code using 65536 codewords (stored on 2 bytes), allowing for many more letters used in languages around the globe.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The graph of a code\n",
    "\n",
    "The codewords of a code can represented as a binary tree.\n",
    "We call this representation **the graph of the code**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example at blackboard\n",
    "\n",
    "### Average code length\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a code for the messages of a discrete memoryless source.\n",
    "There are many ways to define the codewords and their mapping to messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "How to measure representation efficiency of a code? We need this, for example, \n",
    "in order to choose the most efficient code out of all possible codes we might define.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic quantity indicating efficiency of a code is the average code length.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{prf:definition} Average code length\n",
    "Given a code, the **average code length** is the average of the codeword lengths:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\overline{l} = \\sum_i p(s_i) l_i$$\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, for every codeword $c_i$ we consider its probability\n",
    "to be the probability of the corresponding message $p(s_i)$, and its length $l_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A code with smaller average length is better, because it represents sequences of messages\n",
    "with less symbols, on average. However, we expect a certain \n",
    "lower limit to the average length (for example, it cannot be 0, for self-evident reasons).\n",
    "This raises the following interesting question:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Given a source $S$, how small can the average length be?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a fundamental question, to which we will provide an answer later in this chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instantaneous codes\n",
    "\n",
    "We introduce another set of useful definitions regarding the codeword structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "A code is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **non-singular**: all codewords are different\n",
    "- **uniquely decodable**: for any received sequence of symbols, there is only one corresponding sequence of messages\n",
    "  - i.e. no sequence of messages produces the same sequence of symbols\n",
    "  - i.e. there is never a confusion at decoding\n",
    "- **instantaneous** (also known as **prefix-free**): no codeword is prefix to another code\n",
    "  - A **prefix** = a codeword which is the beginning of another codeword\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples: at the blackboard\n",
    "\n",
    "The follwing relations exist between these types of codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{prf:theorem} Instantaneous codes are uniquely decodable\n",
    "An instantaneous code is uniquely decodable\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{prf:proof}\n",
    "\n",
    "There is exactly one codeword matching the beginning of the sequence:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Suppose the true initial codeword is **c**\n",
    "- There can't be a shorter codeword **c'**, since it would be prefix to **c**\n",
    "- There can't be a longer codeword **c''**, since **c** would be prefix to it\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we find the first codeword, write down the corresponding message and remove the codeword from the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The remaining part is another sequence and, by the same argument, there is exactly one codeword matching the new beginning, and so on.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "The converse is not necessary true; there exist uniquely decodable codes which\n",
    "are not instantaneous.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{prf:theorem} Uniquely decodable codes are non-singular\n",
    "An uniquely decodable code is non-singular\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{prf:proof}\n",
    "The proof is by contradiction:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the code is singular, some codewords are not unique (different messages have the same codeword)\n",
    "- This means that at decoding we can't decide which of those messages is there. \n",
    "  This means that the code is not uniquely decodable\n",
    "- Therefore, if the code is uniquely-decodable, it must also be non-singular ($A \\rightarrow B \\Leftrightarrow \\overline{B} \\rightarrow \\overline{A}$)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can summarize the relation between these three code types as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Instantaneous $\\subset$ uniquely decodable $\\subset$ non-singular\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graph-based decoding of instantaneous codes\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the graph of the code, we can use a very simple procedure for decoding any instantaneous code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{prf:algorithm} Graph-based decoding of instantaneous codes\n",
    ":label: graph-based-decoding\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inputs** An input symbol sequence, the graph of an instantaneous code\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output** The decoded message sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start at the root of the tree graph\n",
    "2. Follow the edges in the tree according to the next symbols in the sequence\n",
    "3. When a message is reached in the tree, write it down and go back to the root\n",
    "4. Continue until the end of the symbol sequence\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "TBD: Illustrate at whiteboard\n",
    "\n",
    "This procedure shows the advantage of instantaneous codes over other codes which\n",
    "might be uniquely decodable, but are not instantaneous: \n",
    "instantaneous codes allow for **simple decoding**. There is never any doubt about\n",
    "the next message in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "This decoding scheme is also showing why these codes are named \"*instantaneous*\":\n",
    "a codeword can be decoded as soon as it is fully received, immediately, without any delay.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a counter example, consider the following uniquely decodable, but non-instantaneous code: $\\left\\lbrace 0, 01, 011, 1110 \\right\\rbrace$. When you read the first $0$, you cannot decode it yet, because you need to wait the next bits to understand how to segment the sequence. This implies that the decoding has some delay.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Kraft inequality theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "When can an instantaneous code exist? Given a DMS $S$, are we sure we can find an \n",
    "instantaneous code for it, and if yes, under which conditions?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answers to these questions is provided by the Kraft inequality.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{prf:theorem} Kraft inequality theorem\n",
    "Given a code alphabet of $D$ symbols, there exists an instantaneous code with codeword lengths ${l_1, l_2, \\ldots l_n}$ \n",
    "if and only if the lengths satisfy the following inequality:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_i D^{-l_i} \\leq 1$$\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{prf:proof}\n",
    "At blackboard\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Comments on the Kraft inequality:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If lengths do not satisfy the relation, no instantaneous code exists with these lengths\n",
    "- If the lengths of a code satisfy the relation, that code can be instantaneous or not (there   exists an instantaneous code, but not necessarily that one).\n",
    "  Keep in mind that the Kraft inequality only looks at the lengths of the codewords, not\n",
    "  at their actual symbols, so it can only say something about the lengths, not about the actual codewords\n",
    "- The Kraft inequality implies that the codewords lengths cannot be all very small, because if\n",
    "  all $l_i$ values are too small the sum exceeds 1. Thus, implicitly, it sets a lower limit to the permissible lengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "- From the proof, it follows that we have equality in the relation\n",
    "  \n",
    "  $$ \\sum_i D^{-l_i} = 1$$\n",
    "  \n",
    "  only if the lowest level of the tree is fully covered.\n",
    "  Thus, for an instantaneous code which satisfies Kraft with equality, \n",
    "  all the graph branches terminate with codewords and there are no unused branches.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  This makes sense intuitively, since is most economical way: codewords are as short as they can be. Any unused branch means that we can actually make the code shorter by moving some message up the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen that instantaneous codes must obey the Kraft inequality\n",
    "But how about uniquely decodable codes? \n",
    "The answer is given by the next theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{prf:theorem} McMillan theorem\n",
    "Any uniquely decodable code **also** satisfies the Kraft inequality:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sum_i D^{-l_i} \\leq 1.$$\n",

    "\n",
    "- For every uniquely decodable code, there exists in instantaneous code\n",
    "with the same lengths. This is because the lengths $l_i$ must satisfy the same\n",
    "relation both for unique-decodable and for instantanous codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Thus, even though the class of uniquely decodable codes is larger than that of\n",
    "instantaneous codes (because any instantaneous code is uniquely decodable, but not\n",
    "any uniquely decodable code is instantaneous), using uniquely-decodable codes\n",
    "brings **no additional benefit** in average codeword length\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instead of an uniquely decodable code, we can always use an instantaneous code, \n",
    "which has the same lengths, but is much easier to decode.\n",

    "### Finding an instantaneous code for given lengths\n",
    "\n",
    "How to find codewords with code lengths $\\{l_i\\}$?\n",
